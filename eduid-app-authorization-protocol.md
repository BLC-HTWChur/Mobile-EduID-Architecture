# edu-ID Mobile App App Authorization protocol

The edu-ID Mobile App provides an authorization and authentication interface for securely connecting third party apps with services in the trust domain of Swiss academic services. The edu-ID Mobile App ensures that commercial and non-commercial third party apps can provide added value services based on the existing service infrastructure in Swiss higher education institutions. The edu-ID App's key function is to authorise third party apps on a user's device with academic services within the edu-ID federation. It helps to bridge the user/app store trust domain on the user devices and the trust domain within the Swiss Academic Service Federation.

The edu-ID Mobile App integrates interactions between the edu-ID infrastructure, services in the academic edu-ID federation, and third-party apps installed on the users' devices. It limits service and data exposure to third-parties to authorised sources.

This document describes the authorization protocol between third party apps and the edu-ID mobile app.
