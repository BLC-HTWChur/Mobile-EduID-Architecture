# App UI and User Experience

## Introduction

This section includes the app user interfaces and user experiences and
contains the visual organization of the app user interfaces.

The Swiss edu-ID Mobile App has two interaction modes.

1. The authentication and information mode
2. The authorization mode

The actual app UI diverts from these prototypes if functional requirements
were conflicting with the interface design.

Additionally, all error and information messages were changed from modal message
windows into UI-Views allowing users to navigate the presentated information.
This became particularly useful when displaying the error messages in
authorization mode.

## Authentication and Information Mode

Device owners reach the autnethication and information mode by starting the
Swiss edu-ID Mobile App directly from their device's app launcher.

### Login

### Logout Confirmation

### Basic User Information

## Authorization Mode

The authorization mode is activated if the device owners select the Swiss edu-ID Mobile App
during an authorization request of another app.

### Authorization (Single Authorization)

### Authorization (Multiple Authorizations)

### Authorizyation Error Message
