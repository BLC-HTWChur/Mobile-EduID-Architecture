# Artwork

The Swiss edu-ID mobile app aims for improving the integration of mobiles apps with IT services provided by Swiss Universities.

This document covers the artwork of the edu-ID App.

## Introduction

The edu-ID artwork provides a visual metaphors to the functions of the eduID App.

The edu-ID core artwork uses a lot of thin lines, typography and complex visuals. This artwork follows the metaphors of an ID. The mobile app project tried to reuse the main eduID artwork. However, the original artwork is too complex for icons that are required for mobile apps. Therefore, the Swiss edu-ID Mobile App was seeking for an alternative visual metaphors for the app.

The visual metaphors for the Swiss edu-ID Mobile App needed to meet the following requirements.

* being constrained to a squared bounding box.

* being recognisable at small sizes as small as 29x29 pixel.

* being easily identifiable in monochrome visualisations.

* avoid conflicts with other icons.

The visual metaphors is to "secure cloud services". The visual representation resembles a key chain tag that is attached to a lock.

Alternatives following the ID card metaphors of the edu-ID project have been abandoned, because they would too closely resemble contact/address book apps.
