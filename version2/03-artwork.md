# Artwork

The Swiss edu-ID mobile app aims for improving the integration of mobiles apps with IT services provided by Swiss Universities.

This document covers the artwork of the EduID App.

## Introduction

The EduID artwork provides a visual metaphore to the functions of the eduID App.

The EduID core artwork uses a lot of thin lines, typography and complex visuals. This artwork follows the metaphore of an ID. The mobile app project tried to reuse the main eduID artwork. However, the original artwork is too complex for icons that are required for mobile apps. Therefore, the Swiss EduID Mobile App was seeking for an alternative visual metaphore for the app.

The visual metaphore for the Swiss EduID Mobile App needed to meet the following requirements.

* being constrained to a squared bounding box.

* being recognisable at small sizes as small as 29x29 pixel.

* being easily identifyable in monochrome visualisations.

* avoid conflicts with other icons.

The visual metaphore is to "secure cloud services". The visual representation resembles a keychain tag that is attached to a lock.

Alternatives following the ID card metaphore of the EduID project have been abandoned, because they would too closely resemble contact/addressbook apps.

## Launch Screens

The launch screen uses a large app icon on a white background. This allows to add the typeface logos of swissuniversities and SWITCH.
